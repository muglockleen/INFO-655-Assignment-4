# INFO-655-Assignment-4

So many issues. So many problems. Alas, my brain can not handle anymore and I must go to bed. Here's a brief synopsis of this assignment and the many failures encountered along the way:

* I only got to write basic tests for the Song and Podcast components. This was due to lack of time and just confusion on my part how to test the basic logic flow of the reducer. I probably need to really study how to mock components.
* I could not get the deployment to work. I had originally stopped watching the deployment lecture, figuring it wouldn't be that crazy, and totally forgot about it until late tonight (Thursday evening). I followed as far as I could but really could not last through it all to find out how the issues were finally resolved. I will have to finish watching the video if I expect to deploy my project.
* I realized that I would need to fetch my JSON data from a local file since deployment would render using json-server useless. So I tried to fetch from a file. Should have been really simple but I failed to achieve this. I simply could not read a JSON file no matter how many permutations of putting it in directories I tried.
* I could not figure out how to "npm start?" I could not view my app locally under a build environment at all.

This assignment, for me, was a train wreck. But here it is.
